			<h1>Petter&nbsp;A. Magnusson<span></h1>
			
			<p>I am currently working as a Producer at Gotheburgs largest game development studio as a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thunderfulgames.com">Thunderful Games</a>. In my role as Producer I lead a larger team of developers composed of many different disciplines such as programmers, artists, designers, mucisians and more. Together we develop games from idea to published products on Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo and PC.</p>
			
			<p>In my career I have also been working in web development, user interface design and contious integration. Over time I have also taken on leadership positions where I serve as a bridge between developers and stakeholders.</p>
			
			<p>I look for environments where I can get to know and work with great colleagues and with projects where I can clearly see the impact of my accomplishments.</p>

			<p>In my spare time I love to go out hiking in the Swedish wilderness and to sing karaoke with friends or as a member of the pop choir Vega. I also have a great passion for games, the digital variety as well as games with cards, wooden cubes and dice over the tabletop.</p>

						<h5>Technology Evaluation for future Internet Protocol Television Services<span class="experience__description-context">Ericsson AB - Stockholm, Kista</span></h5>
						<p>Thesis aimed at evaluating Ericssons IPTV-platform and its ability to supply possible future services.</p>
						<p>The project started out with concepting and designing a new fictitious service aimed at using the capabilities of IPTV in terms of interactivity and personalization. The service was then used as a basis for two prototypes developed using the Ericsson platform to evaluate the level of support available. The prototypes could then be used as examples for future projects on the platform.</p>
						<p>Through out the work with the prototypes some challenges with the platform was uncovered in relation to development of new services. Among those were complexity issues in application development leading to the need of an increased knowledge base internally. Potential solutions wre presented based on level of investment required. Some suggestions included more general improvements to the platform.</p>
						<p>The thesis also presented a model for creating smaller services to the platform called Content Interactive Widgets and how they could effect future development of the platform.</p>
